              The <em><a href="http://cida.usgs.gov/ngwmn/" target="_blank">NGWMN Data Portal</a></em> provides access 
              to groundwater data from multiple, dispersed databases in a web-based mapping application. The portal 
              contains current and historical data including water levels, water quality, lithology, and well 
              construction.

           USGS coastal change hazards research produces data, knowledge, and tools about storms, shoreline change, and
           sea-level rise. These information products are available at the <em><a href="http://marine.usgs.gov/coastalchangehazardsportal/"
           target="_blank"> coastal change hazards web portal</a></em>. The portal can be used to increase awareness
           and provide a basis for decision making.

    statement: >
              Recognizing the need for integrated soil moisture data, the President’s Climate Action Plan called for 
              the creation of a coordinated national soil moisture network. In response, a team led by NOAA’s 
              National Integrated Drought Information System completed a proof-of-concept pilot project. The 
              <em><a href="http://cida.usgs.gov/nsmn_pilot/" target="_blank">NSMN Pilot</a></em>, developed 
              collaboratively by Texas A&M and the U.S. Geological Survey, focuses on providing real-time in situ 
              soil moisture data, aggregated from a number of state and federal sources, to feed a map-based 
              visualization and a standard web service. The pilot was developed in order to meet the following 
              use cases: operational drought monitoring, experimental land surface modeling, and operational 
              hydrological modeling. The result of this pilot is a reference architecture that will inform the 
              implementation of an operational national soil moisture network.
